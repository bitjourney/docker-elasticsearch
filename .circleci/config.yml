            # As the official doc says, in Remote Docker:
            #
            #  > "It’s impossible to start a service in remote docker and ping it directly
            #  > from a primary container (and vice versa)"

            #
            # Therefore, the health check can be achieved as follows:
            #
            #   1. Start a new container from 'appropriate/curl' which is a docker image with just 'curl' commnad
            #      - https://hub.docker.com/r/appropriate/curl/
            #
            #   2. Link the container with the ES container which is running in the background with '--network' option
            #
            #   3. Now you can exec 'curl' from the container to the ES container
            docker run --network container:$CONTAINER_NAME \
              appropriate/curl --retry $HEALTH_CHECK_RETRY_LIMIT \
